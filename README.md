# BeeHive
This is my final capstone from Tech Elevator co-written with Amber Gagliardo, Christopher Ballard, Jenna Sawan and Natalie Einselen

Together with my team, we developed a web application “BeeHive” using Spring MVC, RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL, VUE.js, and 3rd Party Google Books API. 

It is designed as a fun and interactive reading app designed to motivate families to read together and foster a love of books in children. With its bee-themed design, the app creates a playful atmosphere that encourages the whole family to engage in reading activities and track their progress. BookHive allows families to easily log their reading time and set goals for how much they want to read. As they log their reading time, they can earn a variety of prizes that can be easily customized. Overall, BookHive is a fun and engaging app that promotes literacy and encourages families to read together. It's sure to BEEcome a favorite of parents and kids alike!
